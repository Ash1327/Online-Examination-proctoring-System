📚 Online Examination Proctoring System

🎯 Project Overview

The Online Examination Proctoring System is a real-time monitoring solution designed to ensure the integrity of online exams by minimizing malpractice. It leverages facial recognition and object detection to track candidates and detect suspicious activities, reducing manual invigilation efforts by 60% and improving examination security.

✨ Features

🎥 Real-time Proctoring: Monitors candidates throughout the exam session.

👤 Facial Recognition: Ensures the correct candidate is taking the exam.

🔍 Anomaly Detection: Detects head movement and unauthorized objects.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, Haar Cascade

Machine Learning: Facial Recognition, Head Pose Estimation

Version Control: Git

🚀 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy
